## -description

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the [CONTAINSSEMANTIC](/windows/win32/search/-search-sql-containssemantic) SQL predicate is supported on the current device.

## -parameters

### -param isContainsSemanticSupported [out]

True if semantic SQL predicates are supported on the current device.

## -returns

Returns S_OK on success.

## -remarks

Starting with Windows 11, build 26100, Windows Search queries can include new SQL syntax that enables searching for semantically-related items. The semantic search syntax includes the **CONTAINSSEMANTIC** predicate and [MERGE](/windows/win32/search/-search-sql-rankby#mergemerge_operation) operations. Older versions of Windows do not support this syntax. **IsContainsSemanticSupported** allows apps to confirm that **CONTAINSSEMANTIC** is supported on the current device before executing queries that use this predicate.
