## -description

Obtains a cloud authentication handle. To call this function successfully, the calling application must be running within the context of the `NetworkService` or `LocalSystem` account.

## -parameters

### activityId [in]

A pointer to a GUID to uniquely identify events related to this operation in Event Viewer. The caller chooses this GUID for their convenience.

## -returns

If the function succeeds, the return value is a valid cloud authentication handle. It should be closed by calling *[WTSCloudAuthClose](./nf-wtsapi32-wtscloudauthclose.md)*. If the function fails, the return value is `NULL`. To get extended error information, call the [`GetLastError`](/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror) function.

## -remarks

A cloud authentication handle can be used for remote Entra ID authentication and authorization purposes using the `WTSCloudAuth*` API family.
