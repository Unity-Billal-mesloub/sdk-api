## -description

Implemented by a search filter to provide information about the dimensions and format of the image being indexed.

## -parameters

### -param imageInfo [out]

An [IMAGE_INFO](ns-filter-image_info.md) structure specifying the dimensions and format of the image being indexed.

## -returns

This method can return one of these values.

| Return code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| S_OK     | Success |
| E_OUTOFMEMORY | Failed to allocate necessary memory. |


## -remarks

The indexer calls **GetImageInfo** first, in order to allocate the necessary buffers for the image. After this method returns, the indexer will call [IPixelFilter::GetPixelsForImage](nf-filter-ipixelfilter-getpixelsforimage.md) one or more times to retrieve the raw image pixels.
