## -returns

If the function succeeds, it returns **ERROR_SUCCESS**. If the function fails, it returns a system error code.

## -remarks

Windows comes installed with three default power modes that have preconfigured power setting values: "Best Power Efficiency", "Balanced", and "Best Performance". These power modes cannot be removed or changed and are the only supported values for the user configured power mode.

> [!NOTE]
> Power modes were previously referred to as "overlays" or "overlay schemes".
