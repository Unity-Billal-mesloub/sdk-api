## -description

Restricts (or restores) access by an enclave to the address space of its containing process. This policy applies to all threads in the enclave.

## -parameters

### -param RestrictAccess

Set this value to `TRUE` if the process should restrict (i.e. disable) access to the address space of the containing process. Otherwise, set it to `FALSE` if restrictions should be relaxed, and the containing address space should be accessible.

### -param PreviouslyRestricted

A pointer to a variable that will receive the previous state of the restriction.

## -returns

An `HRESULT` value that indicates the success or failure of the operation.

## -remarks

Note that the [EnclaveCopyOutOfEnclave](nf-winenclaveapi-enclavecopyoutofenclave.md) and [EnclaveCopyIntoEnclave](nf-winenclaveapi-enclavecopyintoenclave.md) APIs will still continue to work (and access the address space of the containing process) even when access is restricted using **EnclaveRestrictContainingProcessAccess**.

Access to the containing process's address space can also be restricted by setting the [IMAGE_ENCLAVE_POLICY_STRICT_MEMORY](../winnt/ns-winnt-image_enclave_config64.md#-field-enclaveflags) flag in the enclave's image configuration. The **EnclaveRestrictContainingProcessAccess** API can be used to change this policy at runtime.
