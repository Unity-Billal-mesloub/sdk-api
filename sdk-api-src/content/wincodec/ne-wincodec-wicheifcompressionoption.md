## -description

Defines constants that specify High Efficiency Image Format (HEIF) compression options. Allows you to choose which compression format to use when creating a HEIF image file.

## -enum-fields

### -field WICHeifCompressionDontCare:0x0

Specifies that any compression option may be used.

### -field WICHeifCompressionNone:0x1

Specifies that no compression be used.

### -field WICHeifCompressionHEVC:0x2

Specifies that High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) compression be used.

### -field WICHeifCompressionAV1:0x3

Specifies that AOMedia Video 1 (AV1) compression be used.

### -field WICHeifCompressionJpegXL:0x4

Specifies that JPEG XL should be used as the image compression format inside the HEIF file. Since JPEG XL supports both lossy and lossless compression, the *Lossless* compression option must also be set to **VARIANT_TRUE** to enable lossless encoding using JPEG XL. The *CompressionQuality* compression option is also available when using JPEG XL. *CompressionQuality* is a floating point number between 0 and 1, and the default value is 0.45. Larger values result in a smaller image size, at the expense of longer encoding time.

### -field WICHeifCompressionBrotli:0x5

Specifies that the Brotli lossless compression algorithm will be applied to the pixels. Brotli is defined in RFC 7932. Brotli generally provides a higher compression ratio than **WICHeifCompressionDeflate**, at the expense of being slower.

### -field WICHeifCompressionDeflate:0x6

Specifies that the Deflate lossless compression algorithm will be applied to the pixels. Defalate is defined in RFC 1951. Deflate is generally *faster* than Brotli, but it doesn't compress as well.

### -field WICHEIFCOMPRESSIONOPTION_FORCE_DWORD
